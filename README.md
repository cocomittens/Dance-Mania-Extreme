# Dance Mania Xtreme
Dance Mania Xtreme is a rhythm game inspired by the classic games Dance Dance Revolution and Stepmania created in HTML5 Canvas and Javascript. Players can choose a song and difficulty on the song selection menu, which will then start the game. Players will have to hit arrows at the right time in order to achieve a high score. The player will receive a score of "Miss", "Bad", "OK", "Great", and "Perfect!" for each arrow, depending on close the player is to hitting it at the right time. Scores of "Great" and "Perfect!" will contribute to a combo, which will be broken if any other score is subsequently received. These scores are measured with a progress bar at the top and are calculated at the end to assign the playe a grade of "SSS" to "D". Be careful, however, as if the progress bar gets too low the song will stop early and the player will receive a grade of "F"!
