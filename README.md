# MyLife

## Background and Overview
`Reincarnation` is a text-based life simulator (images/ other visual information to be added if time allows). Ever wonder what it would be like if you were born as someone else? Experience life as a farmer in 1900s Pennsylvania, a modern European tech executive, or a Buddhist Monk in China. You may not be able to control the hands you are dealt, but you can choose what you do with them!

In Reincarnation, players will be able to:
  - [ ] Generate a new life with random traits in a random place, time and occupation
  - [ ] Choose items, skills, relationships, life events etc. as time goes on
  - [ ] Affect the outcome of their life based on their choices
